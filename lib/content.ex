    Tomorrow, tomorrow, and tomorrow
    Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
    To the last sylable of recorded time.
    And all our yesterdays have lighted fools, 
    the way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!

    Life is but a walking shadow, a poor player 
    that struts and frets his way upon the stage, 
    and then is heard no more. 
    It is a tale told by an idiot
    Full of sound and fury,

    That kept so many warm.
    Iâ€™ve heard it in the chillest land,
    And on the strangest sea;
    Yet, never, in extremity,
    It asked a crumb of me.
